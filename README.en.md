Note, the master branch may not contain latest dev process. See the list of branches

#### Software Architecture
The overall architecture of Dysche is originated from Linux AMP(Asychronous Multi-Processing) architecture.
In general, there are two parts in Dysche arch: Linux kernel part and the Linux userspace part. In this
repo, we'll focus on userspace part.

For Dysche userspace design, there are several componets logically:

- A tool to handle APP-OS images, load the image and verify the image etc.

- Interface with the Dysche kernel part, run the APP-OS.

- A system service to interfere with Dysche kernel part, maintain/operate APP-OS on the fly, provide
devices emulation etc.
